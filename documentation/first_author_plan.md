# First Author Plan - Amyloid PET Pipeline

## My Contributions
1. **Pipeline Development**: Created complete FSL-based processing pipeline
2. **Problem Solving**: Identified and solved intensity scaling issues
3. **Validation**: Implemented comparison with GAIN reference dataset
4. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive pipeline documentation
5. **Quality Control**: Added automated QC checks and reporting

## Key Technical Achievements
- SUVR extraction matching GAIN reference values for good data
- Multiple reference region support (CG, WC, Pons)
- Automated intensity normalization
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## For the Paper
### Methods Section I Will Write:
1. PET preprocessing pipeline (FSL-based)
2. SUVR calculation methodology
3. Quality control procedures
4. Validation against GAIN dataset

### Results I Will Present:
1. SUVR values for 25 AD + 25 YC subjects
2. Comparison with GAIN reference (correlation analysis)
3. Quality control metrics
4. Intensity normalization improvements

### Figures I Will Create:
1. Pipeline workflow diagram
2. SUVR distribution (AD vs YC)
3. Correlation with GAIN values
4. QC examples (good vs problematic)

## Next Steps for First Authorship
1. Run complete pipeline with all subjects
2. Document intensity normalization procedure
3. Compare results with team's alternative pipeline
4. Prepare manuscript draft with my contributions highlighted
5. Create presentation slides for lab meeting
